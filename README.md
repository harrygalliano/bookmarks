# Bookmarks Challenge

We were tasked with creating a bookmarking tool with the following features:

  - Show a list of bookmarks
  - Add new bookmarks
  - Delete bookmarks
  - Update bookmarks
  - Comment on bookmarks
  - Tag bookmarks into categories
  - Filter bookmarks by tag
  - Users manage their bookmarks

We broke this down into the user stories below:

1. Show a list of bookmarks
```
As a user.
So that I can see bookmarks.
Show me a list of bookmarks when I click browse.
```

Then we create domain models for these stories [here](https://www.draw.io/#G15yQIhLtMiCLSRnRoNFhIoWoJofYfC7DW).
